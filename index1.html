				SCHORDER: Did you know that Charlie Brown has never pitched a winning
				baseball game? Never been able to keep a kite in the air? Never

				football? Sometimes I marvel at his consistency.

				IF I START WRITING NOW
				WHEN I'M NOT REALLY RESTED
				IT COULD UPSET MY THINKING
				WHICH IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.
				I'LL GET A FRESH START TOMORROW
				AND IT'S NOT DUE TILL WEDNESDAY,
				SO I'LL HAVE ALL OF TUESDAY,
				UNLESS SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN.
				WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN
				I SHOULD BE OUTSIDE PLAYING,
				GETTING FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE,
				I WORK BEST UNDER PRESSURE
				AND THERE'LL BE LOTS OF PRESSURE
				IF I WAIT TILL TOMORROW,
				I SHOULD START WRITING NOW.
				BUT IF I START WRITING NOW WHEN
				I'M NOT REALLY RESTED,
				IT COULD UPSET MY THINKING WHICH IS NO GOOD AT ALL.
